# Personalized Product Recommendation System

This repository contains the code for a personalized product recommendation system using a collaborative filtering approach. The system recommends products to a customer based on the products they have previously purchased. The recommendations are generated by calculating the cosine similarity between the products in the dataset and recommending products that are similar to the ones the customer has purchased.

## Features

- **Encoding Features**: The system encodes categorical features using `LabelEncoder`.
- **Product Features**: The system normalizes numerical product features and creates a feature matrix.
- **Cosine Similarity**: The system calculates the cosine similarity between products to find similar products.
- **Recommendations**: The system recommends products based on the similarity scores.
