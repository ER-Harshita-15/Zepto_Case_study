# Delivery Optimization Project

This project aims to analyze and optimize delivery times using various scripts and a Jupyter notebook. Below is a detailed description of each file and its functionality.

## Files Overview

### 1. `deliveryinsights.py`

This script generates insights for delivery optimization by calculating and plotting average delivery times.

#### Key Functions:
- **`__init__(self, dataset_path)`**: Initializes the class with the dataset path and creates a directory for plots.
- **`calculate_average_delivery_time(self)`**: Calculates the average delivery time grouped by city and product category.
- **`plot_average_delivery_time(self)`**: Plots the average delivery time by city and product category.

#### Usage:
```bash
python deliveryinsights.py
```

### 2. `deliveryrouteoptimization.py`

This script analyzes delivery data and trains a model to predict delivery times.

#### Key Functions:
- **`__init__(self, file_path)`**: Initializes the class with the dataset path and creates a directory for plots.
- **`plot_distribution(self)`**: Plots the distribution of delivery times.
- **`plot_delivery_by_city(self)`**: Plots delivery times by city.
- **`plot_delivery_by_category(self)`**: Plots delivery times by product category.
- **`plot_delivery_times_by_order_day(self)`**: Plots delivery times by order day.
- **`train_model(self)`**: Trains a Random Forest model to predict delivery times and plots feature importance.

#### Usage:
```bash
python deliveryrouteoptimization.py
```

### 3. `deliveryinsightsnotebook.ipynb`

This Jupyter notebook provides an interactive way to calculate and plot average delivery times.

#### Key Cells:
- **Import Libraries**: Imports necessary libraries such as pandas, seaborn, and matplotlib.
- **`calculate_average_delivery_time(df)`**: Function to calculate average delivery time grouped by city and product category.
- **`plot_average_delivery_time(grouped_data)`**: Function to plot average delivery time by city and product category.
- **Load Dataset**: Loads the dataset from the specified path.
- **Calculate and Plot**: Calculates and plots the average delivery time.

#### Usage:
Open the notebook in Jupyter and run the cells sequentially.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is located at `../Data/updated_dataset.csv`. It contains the following columns:
- `City`: The city where the delivery is made.
- `Product_Category`: The category of the product delivered.
- `Delivery_Time_mins`: The time taken for delivery in minutes.
- `Order_Time`: The time when the order was placed.
- `Payment_Method`: The method used for payment.
- `High_Spender_Flag`: A flag indicating if the customer is a high spender.

## Plots Directory

All plots generated by the scripts and notebook are saved in the `plots` directory.

## Requirements

- Python 3.12.6
- pandas
- seaborn
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook (for the notebook file)

## Installation

Install the required packages using pip:
```bash
pip install pandas seaborn matplotlib scikit-learn jupyter
```

## Conclusion

This project provides tools to analyze and optimize delivery times, helping to improve delivery efficiency and customer satisfaction. Use the provided scripts and notebook to gain insights and train predictive models.
